Cymbiote
========

A small project to create a simple C++ mud server, with a relatively original science-fiction theme. 

Features
--------
No features have yet been implemented, sorry! All remains but a twinkle in the eyes of its designer.

ToDo: Features
--------------
It is intended that the following features will be added over time:
  * Implementation of the common telnet MUD protocols - ANSI colours, MCCP and so on;
  * Implementation of both room-based (interior/exterior environments) and coordinate-based (interplanetary) movement systems;
  * Support for in-game OLC over telnet and through a web-based interface;
  * Support for in-game threaded discussion forums, also linked to a web-based interface;
  * Support for in-game 'wiki'-like documentation system, also linked to a web-based interface;
  * Scripting support (language yet to be determined);
  * Hopefully more as I get underway!
